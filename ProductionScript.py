# and the corresponding name you want associated with that sequence, these name will be used throughout all naming
# including:fasta file names, alphafold out folders, in file fasta identifiers, plddt data files and so on

# The second is a chimera_arguments.json file modified to your liking, this file has naming conventions for all important
# files generated like fasta and msas, for analysis later keep naming conventions consistent, the naming works by replacing the
# character_to_replace which is defaulted with an asterisk ('*'), with the names supplied in the protein_info list that was generated
# for the last input, there are also a couple operation that come as arrays with enclosed in [] and the first input is just
# quotations "", if you place a # within the quotes it will prevent that file from being created, for example you prevent
